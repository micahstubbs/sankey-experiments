#### Help! Sankey labels not transitioning properly

This is the sankey from my working [federal budget dashboard](https://bl.ocks.org/MasonChinkin/5776c090ef29ad707e7835ee001662bd). For some reason when I try to apply transitions in the traditional way, the labels dont relocate properly.

I suspect it has something to do with sankey.js realligning the sankey categories by size every time the data is refreshed, but haven't been able to find a solution.

For reference, there are some [great blocks demonstrating transitioning sankeys](https://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/77c7f7e8802e8824eed473dd065c450b)
